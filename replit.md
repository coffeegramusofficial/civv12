# Russian Civil War Card Game

## Overview

A 2D Hearthstone-style strategy card game set during the Russian Civil War (1917-1923). Players choose between the White Army (Imperial Loyalists) and Red Army (Bolsheviks) factions, building decks and deploying cards in a lane-based tactical battle system. The objective is to destroy the enemy's main tower while defending your own through strategic card placement and combat management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Core Technologies:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe UI development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- Radix UI components for accessible, unstyled primitives

**State Management Strategy:**
- Zustand stores for global game state (`useGameState`) and audio control (`useAudio`)
- React Query (@tanstack/react-query) configured for server data fetching with infinite stale time and no refetch
- Local component state using React hooks for UI-specific concerns

**Game Rendering Approach:**
- 2D Hearthstone-style interface with lane-based card positioning (left, center, right lanes)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Framer Motion for card play animations, hover effects, and UI transitions
- Gradient backgrounds and visual effects for faction theming

**Game Flow Architecture:**
- **Menu Phase:** Main menu with faction selection, deck building, and settings
- **Faction Select Phase:** Choose between White Army or Red Army
- **Deck Building Phase:** Create and save custom 8-card decks from faction-specific cards
- **Playing Phase:** Active turn-based gameplay on lane-based battlefield
- **Game Over Phase:** Victory/defeat screen with reset capability

**Component Organization:**
- Game-specific components in `client/src/components/game/`
- UI primitives in `client/src/components/ui/` (Radix-based)
- 2D implementations: `GameScreen2D.tsx`, `Card2D.tsx`, `Tower2D.tsx`, `Board2D.tsx`
- Legacy 3D components preserved but unused (React Three Fiber, Three.js)

**Game Logic:**
- Card types: Units (assault, support, spy) and Bonuses (medic, engineer, instructor, aerial)
- Flying units converted to aerial bombardment bonus cards (attack towers directly, ignore enemy units)
- Spy units (–†–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥—á–∏–∫-—à–ø–∏–æ–Ω for Whites, –ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ç –í–ß–ö for Reds) attack main tower directly
- Lane-based positioning with three slots per faction
- Combat system: center lane attacks enemies ‚Üí side towers ‚Üí main tower
- Turn-based resource management: +3 supply per turn, max supply tracked
- Tower defense mechanics (main tower + side towers with 10/6/6 health)

**Data Persistence:**
- LocalStorage for deck persistence with versioning system
- Deck storage includes card names (not full data) for migration flexibility
- Maximum 10 saved decks per user with automatic pruning

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js server with TypeScript
- Vite middleware integration for development HMR
- Custom logging middleware for API request tracking

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints for game session management
- Placeholder routes for future multiplayer functionality
- Routes: game session creation, state retrieval, action processing, statistics

**Development vs Production:**
- Development: Vite dev server with HMR for instant feedback
- Production: Static file serving from compiled `dist/public` directory
- Environment-aware setup in `server/vite.ts`

**Storage Layer:**
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) for development
- Interface-based design (`IStorage`) for future database integration
- User management schema defined but not actively used in current game flow

### External Dependencies

**Database:**
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL (via `@neondatabase/serverless`)
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` with user table
- Migration support via `drizzle-kit` (currently unused for game state)
- Connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

**UI Component Libraries:**
- Extensive Radix UI component collection for accessible primitives:
  - Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, Accordion, Alert Dialog
  - Select, Checkbox, Radio Group, Slider, Switch
  - Navigation Menu, Context Menu, Hover Card
  - Tabs, Toast, Progress, Scroll Area
- `class-variance-authority` for component variant styling
- `cmdk` for command palette functionality

**Animation & 3D (Legacy):**
- `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for 3D rendering (not used in current 2D version)
- `@react-three/postprocessing` for shader effects (not used)
- `vite-plugin-glsl` for shader support
- Framer Motion for 2D animations (actively used)

**Build & Development Tools:**
- TypeScript with strict mode and ESNext modules
- Path aliases: `@/` for client source, `@shared/` for shared code
- PostCSS with Tailwind and Autoprefixer
- Asset handling for GLTF/GLB models and audio files (MP3, OGG, WAV)

**Runtime:**
- `tsx` for TypeScript execution in development
- `esbuild` for server-side bundling in production
- Environment variable management for database connections

**Critical AI Architecture Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed AI supply system: AI now receives +3 supply at START of turn (not end)
  - Previously AI received supply at end of turn, causing it to be capped at 3
  - Now AI gets supply when turn begins, allowing proper accumulation
- ‚úÖ AI can now accumulate unlimited supply points
  - Removed maxSupply restriction for AI (same as player)
  - AI can bank resources across multiple turns for strategic plays
- ‚úÖ Refactored AI turn logic with recursive card playing
  - Replaced problematic synchronous while loop with recursive `playNextAICard` function
  - Each card plays with 600ms delay for smooth animations
  - Eliminates race conditions by ensuring state updates between card plays
  - `aiAttackPhase` function handles attack phase separately after all cards played
  - Clean turn handoff to player after AI attacks complete
- ‚úÖ AI now plays multiple cards per turn based on available supply
  - Plays cards until supply runs out or no playable cards remain
  - AI strategically plays aerial bombardment cards first, then units
  - Proper state synchronization prevents card disappearance issues
- ‚úÖ Player mechanics preserved and stable
  - playCard, attackWithCard, and playBonusCard functions unchanged
  - boardCards state properly maintained across all operations
  - Card parameters remain correct throughout gameplay

**Critical Combat Bug Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed critical combat damage bug where cards were not taking damage
  - attackWithCard was applying damage but immediately overwriting with old state
  - Now gets fresh state AFTER damage is applied, preserving health changes
  - Cards now properly take damage and die when health reaches 0
  - Counter-attack damage also works correctly
- ‚úÖ Fixed tower health values: Main tower = 15 HP, Side towers = 10 HP
- ‚úÖ Fixed supply UI to show current/max format (e.g., "üí∞ 6/9")
- ‚úÖ Fixed supply system: both supply and maxSupply increase by 3 each turn
- ‚úÖ Fixed cards disappearing bug: dead cards properly filtered in combat targeting

**Version Updates:**
- ‚úÖ Version updated to 2.10

**Previous Updates (v2.8 - October 13, 2025):**

- ‚úÖ Converted flying units to aerial bombardment bonus cards (ignore units, attack towers directly)
- ‚úÖ Added spy unit class: "–†–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥—á–∏–∫-—à–ø–∏–æ–Ω" (Whites), "–ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ç –í–ß–ö" (Reds) - attack main tower directly
- ‚úÖ Supply generation increased from +1 to +3 per turn for faster gameplay
- ‚úÖ Combat mechanics improved: center lane attacks enemies first, then side towers, then main tower
- ‚úÖ Enhanced AI logic to play bonus cards and use aerial bombardment strategically
